# Contour-detection-of-multicolored-clothes
Contour detection of simulated multicolored clothes

Table1.blend file is used to simulate different types of multi-colored cloth.
10 cloth designs are used and saved to layers 11-20 in blender file. A table is designed on layer 1.
Different layers are used to render the images of cloth and saved in the folders from Cloth1 to Cloth 10.

Different layers of clothes with table are used to render the images of cloth being set on the table and saved in Sim_with_table folder.

contour_detection.py is used to detect the contour of multicolored cloth (based on convex hull method)
convert_to_video.py converts the image to a video.
